Apocalyptic Shacks, Props and Structures
Hi and thanks for purchasing, I hope you enjoy the pack as much as I enjoyed making it :)
Contact me at tenton3d@gmail.com - I'm happy to help or hear about any imrpovements / ideas on the pack.

Please view the quick guide images on how best to use the platforms, ramps, and platform specific walls.

---AssetShowcase scene---
Here you can find all prefabs in the pack.

---BuildYourOwn Example scenes 1-5---
These small scenes are to show imaginative ways the prefabs can be put together, and help get your creative juices flowing.

---Platforms / Ramps,Stairs / platform specific walls---
Please view the quick guide images on how best to use the platforms, ramps, and platform specific walls.

---Doors & Walls---
Doors work on a hinge joint, run into them to open
They fit into the 'entrance..' wall prefabs found in "Walls and Entrance". They also fit in the platform specific entrances found in the platform folder. 

---Build your own Examples folder---
Here are some pre-made shacks created from the individual prefab peices. Check these out to get inspired to make your own. Or simply place down to fill up your scene.

---Unique Shack And Structures folder---
Shacks / structures made up of custom geometry not found in the individual pieces.

---"Physics Fun" folder---
Apart from the doors and the trapdoor platform, these are the other objects with physics enabled and can make for fun little set pieces in your project.

---Materials---
Most prefabs use the Apocalyptic_D PBR material. This uses one 2048 atlas which greatly reduces draw calls. There are some extra materials which are for particles / neons.
The master PSD holds all the layers for the different maps.

---Neon signs.---
These use a simple UV scroll script and emissive material to flash on / off.

---Lights---
Bulbs are seperate objects and use a different 'bulb' material

---Standard Assets---
The fire barrel and player prefabs both use scripts from standard assets. Cinematic effects are also stored here.

--LODS---
Some shacks / props have LOD groups added. You may wish to adjust the range at which the levels switch depending on your level design / fog level.

-Tip- You need to use light probes to remove strange light popping between LODS. This issue is discussed here https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/lod-group-baked-lighting-how-to-use.349103/#post-2264273


Thanks again -
